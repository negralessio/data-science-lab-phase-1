# Data Science Lab 2023: Group 5 Targaryen 
This repository contains our project of the phase 1 of the **Practical Course: Data Science for Scientific Data** at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The project is about the 'Richter's Predictor: Modeling Earthquake Damage' competition ([Link](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/)).

## Setting up the environment and run the code on a local machine
Note: Make sure Python 3.10 is installed

1. Clone the repository with:

       git clone https://git.scc.kit.edu/data-science-lab-2023/group-5-targaryen/phase-1.git

2. Install the requirements:

       pip install -r phase-1/requirements.txt

3. Insert the data in phase-1/data/raw
4. Navigate into project root and execute the pipeline with:

       cd phase-1
       python3 src/main.py --config "configs/config.yml"

## Execute on a linux server using a script
The build.sh script includes the correct command to run the Python code, and to specifies any required command line 
arguments or configuration files.

1. Clone the GitLab repository to your server using the git clone command. For example:

```git clone https://git.scc.kit.edu/data-science-lab-2023/group-5-targaryen/phase-1.git```

2. Change into the cloned repository directory:

```cd phase-1```

3. Make the build.sh script executable:

```chmod +x build.sh```

4. Run the build.sh script to install any required dependencies and run the Python code:

```./build.sh```

This should execute the script and run the Python code specified in src/main.py.

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to execute the Python code from this Repo on your Linux server.
